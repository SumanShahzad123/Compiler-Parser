# Compiler-Parser
Lab Compiler Construction with instructor Mr. Laeeq Khan Niazi. 
In this lab we will be improving parser code step by step using STL in C++. 
Our task will be following:
1. Task1 Turn this code like passing the file name from cmd (Done in lab1)
and take that code and pass accordingly.
2. Making your language errors more human friendly to display the line
number of the error.
3. Add more data types like float, double, string, bool, char into your
language,
4. Add more keywords into your language
5. Change the structure of conditions like you can turn if statement into Agar
or any keyword of your choice.
6. Add the loop feature into your language (while or for)
7. Add logical expressions into your language inside if conditions like &&, ||,
== and !=
8. Introduce the symbol table in your code (If not done so far) (Use best
possible data structure that you can meet best performance) in your
document also mention the reason of choosing the data structure.
